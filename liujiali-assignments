## Set up

1. Make sure you have the following installed on your system: $\text{\LaTeX}$, R4.2.2+, RStudio 2023.12+, and Quarto 1.3.450+.
2. Clone the course [repo](https://github.com/yanshuotan/st5209-2024).
3. Create a separate folder in the root directory of the repo, label it with your name, e.g. `yanshuo-assignments`
4. Copy the assignment1.qmd file over to this directory.
5. Modify the duplicated document with your solutions, writing all R code as code chunks.
6. When running code, make sure your working directory is set to be the folder with your assignment .qmd file, e.g. `yanshuo-assignments`. This is to ensure that all file paths are valid.[^1]

[^1]: You may view and set the working directory using `getwd()` and `setwd()`.

## Submission

1. Render the document to get a .pdf printout.
2. Submit both the .qmd and .pdf files to Canvas.

## Question 1 (Quarto)

Read the [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) on using Quarto with R and answer the following questions:

a) Write a code chunk that imports `tidyverse` and `fpp3`.

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("fpp3")

b) Modify the chunk so that only the following output is shown (i.e. the usual output about attaching packages and conflicts is not shown.)

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../_images/quarto_chunk_output.png}

> if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
+ install.packages("tidyverse")
+ }
> 
> if (!requireNamespace("fpp3", quietly = TRUE)) {
+ install.packages("fpp3")
+ }

c) Modify the chunk so that it is executed but no code is shown at all when rendered to a pdf.

d) Modify the document so that your name is printed on it beneath the title.

## Question 2 (Livestock)

Consider the `aus_livestock` dataset loaded in the `fpp3` package.

a) Use `filter()` to extract a time series comprising the monthly total number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, Australia, from Jul 1972 to Dec 2018. 
> library(fpp3)
> pigs <- aus_livestock %>% 
+ filter(Animal == 'Pigs' & State == 'Victoria')
b) Make a time plot of the resulting time series.
> pigsSlaughteredInVictoriaPlot <- pigs %>%
+ autoplot(Count) +
+ labs(title = 'Pigs Slaughtered in Victoria Timeseries')
> pigsSlaughteredInVictoriaPlot

## Question 3 (Data cleaning)

Inspect the function `process_sgcpi()` located in `_code/clean_data.R`.
This function is used to convert the raw Consumer Price Index (CPI) data in `_data/raw/sg-cpi.csv` into a tsibble, stored in `_data/cleaned/sgcpi.rds`.

a) In line 9, what does `skip = 10` and `n_max = 152` do? Why do we need to do this when reading the csv file?
 In line 9, skip = 10 and n_max = 152 are used to specify parameters when reading the CSV file. skip = 10 means skipping the first 10 rows of the file, and n_max = 152 limits the maximum number of rows to be read to 152. These parameters are set to extract a specific subset of data from the file. Typically, the initial rows of a CSV file may contain headers, comments, or other non-data information. By using skip and n_max, we ensure that only the rows containing actual CPI data are read, avoiding the interpretation of unnecessary information as data.
b) In line 14, what does `t()` do? Why do we need to do this in order to make a tsibble?
In line 14, t() is the transpose function in R. It is used to swap rows and columns in a matrix or data frame. In this context, it may be because the raw data is stored in a row-wise format, while tsibble generally expects time series data to be stored column-wise. By applying t(), we transpose the original data frame, exchanging rows and columns, to conform to the tsibble requirement where rows represent time points, and columns represent different variables or dimensions. This step helps organize the data into a format suitable for creating a tsibble.

## Question 4 (Beer production)

Consider the `aus_production` dataset loaded in the `fpp3` package.
We will study the column measuring the production of beer.

a) Make a time plot of the beer production time series.
> library(fpp3)
> autoplot(aus_production, Beer) +
+ ggtitle("Beer Production in Australia") +
+ ylab("Beer Production (Million Liters)") +
+ xlab("Year")
b) Describe the observed trend.
Displays clear periodicity with an overall trend characterized by an initial rapid increase followed by a gradual decline.
c) Make a seasonal plot.
gg_season(aus_production,y=Beer, labels="right")
d) What is the period of the seasonality?
1 year
e) Describe the seasonal behavior.
Q4 is the most frequent, followed by Q1, then Q3, and finally Q2.

## Question 5 (Pelts)

Consider the `pelt` dataset loaded in the `fpp3` package, which measures the Hudson Bay Company trading records for Snowshoe Hare and Canadian Lynx furs from 1845 to 1935.

a) Plot both time series on the same axes. *Hint: Use `pivot_longer()` to create a key column*.
> pelt %>%
+ pivot_longer(cols = c(Hare, Lynx), names_to = "Species", values_to = "Count") %>%
+ autoplot(Count, color = "Species", facets = TRUE) +
+ ggtitle("Trading Records for Snowshoe Hare and Canadian Lynx Furs") +
+ ylab("Count") +
+ xlab("Year")
b) What happens when you try to use ``gg_season()`` to the lynx fur time series? What is producing the error?
pelt %>%
  gg_season(Lynx)
c) Make a lag plot with the first 20 lags. Which lags display strong positive correlation? Which lags display strong negative correlation? Verify this with the time plot.
pelt %>%
  gg_lag(Lynx, max_lag = 20)
d) If you were to guess the seasonality period based on the lag plot, what would it be?
By observing the lag plot, a guess for the seasonality period could be 10
e) Use the provided function ``gg_custom_season()` in `_code/plot_util.R`[^2] to make a seasonal plot for lynx furs with the period that you guessed.[^3] Does the resulting plot suggest seasonality? Why or why not?
source("../_code/plot_util.R")
gg_custom_season(pelt, Lynx, season_period = 10) +
  ggtitle("Seasonal Plot for Canadian Lynx Furs") +
  ylab("Count") +
  xlab("Year")

[^2]:You can load this function using `source("../_code/plot.util.R")`.
[^3]: Unfortunately, it seems ``gg_season()` does not allow this functionality.
